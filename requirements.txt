# pip install playwright-stealth

# Notes:
# - Heavy AI/ML, GPU, and experimental dependencies have been moved to
#   `requirements-optional.txt` to avoid install failures on many systems.
# - If you need the full AI stack, install `requirements-optional.txt` in
#   an environment with sufficient resources and platform-specific toolchains.
